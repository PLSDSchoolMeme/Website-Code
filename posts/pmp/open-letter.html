          An open letter to PLSD
          Due to recent events, it has become increasingly obvious that you are aware of our presence on social media.
          Though to you, it may seem that our only goal is to make fun of you and the school board at large that is not
          our goal. Our goal is and always has been to bring attention to students' grievances in an openly creative and
          expressive way. This hole has igrown with the recent deletion of the PLSD Instagram page and the blocking of
          students for speaking out against you.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
          The reputation of the Pickerington schools as we know it has been dragged through the mud and tarnished with
          scandal. This is why we request an open and honest forum with the school board / Superintendent Chris Briggs
          to properly convey the grievances of the student body as a whole, As well as allowing you to openly defend
          your decisions on several key issues that have been deemed ignored by the community.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
          These include but aren't limited to The sexual assault allegations of last summer. Why central needs a new
          football field, as well as why the new Jr. High that we desperately need is being used to get it. And most
          obviously why you decided to open school fully on April 5th. As well as how you plan to keep students safe in
          these unprecedented times going forward. Likewise, we will also answer any questions you have for us.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">We request a meeting be held in an open forum to better express our/your ideas to
          the community as a whole. Our goal has always been to create change and the first step in doing so is through
          open cooperation with the people who run the school. If you agree to this meeting we request that you contact
          us through Twitter or Instagram DMs of Pickerington school memes or any of our associates who have agreed to
          cosign this letter or through Admin@plsdschoolmeme.com to coordinate a time and place. We look forward to
          working with you to make PLSD a better place for everyone.</p>
