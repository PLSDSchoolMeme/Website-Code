        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
          On Friday, March 19, a woman was harassed by several men at the Eastland Career Center. The woman was in her
          car when it happened, where several men, students of the career center, surrounded her car and began yelling
          racial slurs and “White Power” at her in addition to holding up Trump flags. However, this wasn't the first
          time something like this has happened at the Eastland Career Center or Fairfield Career Center. In fact, this
          kind of behavior is quite frequent.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
          A disclosed statement revealed that students who attend one of these career centers have been sending gruesome
          photos to people of color, who are also students of the same career center. The PSU has also received
          information from direct sources that it has been normalized to say derogatory terms and racial slurs to other
          students at these places of education.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
          Obviously, there is a significant issue regarding racism at these learning centers which needs to be addressed
          immediately. So, the students did just that. On March 22 and March 23, two protests were held at Fairfield
          Career Center. And another assembly was held at the Eastland Career Center on March 24. The goal of the
          protests was to remove the students who harassed the woman on March 19 from the school, but the harassers were
          suspended, along with several students who took part in the protests.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">When interviewing one of the students about why the goal of removing the
          harassers would be beneficial, the student explained that “...getting [the harassers] removed would have a
          positive impact on the students who don’t feel safe [at school]...”. The interviewee also stated that
          “...those boys shouldn’t be there if they aren't being professional.”. Many students from those schools don’t
          feel safe in a place meant for education, a location of simulation for jobs. The student further explained
          that “...there is no alternative…” to removing the boys who harassed a fellow peer. </p>
        <h2>Quotes from the interview:</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">In response to “A part of what we'll post is your goal and you already stated
          that it was to have them removed from the career center. Is there any alternative to that? If not, could you
          elaborate more on what the purpose of them getting removed would do?”.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">The interviewee stated: <br>
          “There is no alternative. Considering the career center is a school you have to be accepted into, a simulation
          of a job, and a place of education. Racism should not be tolerated.” <br>“They should be kicked out because
          the career centers perceive themselves as a more professional environment…”<br>
          “Getting them removed would have a significant impact on the students who aren’t safe there, they would feel
          as if the school actually cares about their safety and that the school actually is taking this seriously.
          Those boys shouldn’t be there if they aren’t being professional.”<br>
          “I just want everyone to be able to go to school and people of color are able to feel safe, as it stands no
          one feels safe.”
